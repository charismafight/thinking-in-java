### codes in thinking in java
This book is suitable for a programmer who has a little coding experience.I read this book quickly but get a lot.I can't  imagine that it's a book written in 2006.
Many thought in it are advanced even in 2017.So it's really a classic java reading.  

Many codes of this book is deprecated by newer java edition,so I have changed them in this project.
